Proposal 2:
I would also like to work on data science and visualization tools offered by python. Using packages like numbly, pandas, and marplotlib. I would like to visualize and analyze datasets offered by the Chicago open API. It may change, but there a few ideas that have come to mind for me. Using Crime data by zip code I could see the extent to which covid case rates were potentially related to different crimes like domestic battery, abuse, etc, and I could even run some simple regressions.
